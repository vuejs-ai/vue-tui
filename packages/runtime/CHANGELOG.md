# Changelog

All notable changes to `@vue-tui/runtime` are documented here.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). While on
`0.x`, minor versions may include breaking changes.

## Unreleased

### Features

- Add `ScrollBox`, a bounded app-managed scroll viewport with SGR mouse-wheel
  support and sticky-bottom behavior for streaming output.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-19

First public release of `@vue-tui/runtime` — Vue 3 for the terminal. Build CLI
tools, dashboards, and AI-agent interfaces with `<script setup>` and reactivity,
laid out by real Yoga flexbox (`yoga-layout`, the engine behind Ink and React
Native).

This release covers `@vue-tui/runtime` only; the testing and CLI packages remain
experimental (`0.0.x`). Not recommended for production yet.

### Features

- **Rendering** — `createApp(component).mount(options?)` and a synchronous
  `renderToString()`.
- **Components** — `Box`, `Text`, `Newline`, `Spacer`, `Static`, `Transform`.
- **Layout** — Yoga flexbox: direction, wrap, align, justify, gap, padding,
  margin, and borders.
- **Input & focus** — `useInput`, `usePaste`, `useFocus`, `useFocusManager`,
  `useStdin`.
- **App & environment** — `useApp`, `useStdout`, `useStderr`, `useWindowSize`,
  `useIsScreenReaderEnabled`.
- **Layout & cursor** — `useBoxMetrics`, `measureElement`, `useCursor`.
- **Animation** — frame-based `useAnimation`.
- **Accessibility** — a screen-reader linearizer and ARIA roles (18-value
  `AriaRole` union).
- **Kitty keyboard protocol** — all 5 progressive-enhancement flags, plus
  bracketed paste; `kittyFlags`, `kittyModifiers`, and related types.
- **Authoring** — Vue SFC `<template>`, JSX/TSX, and render functions.

### Built on Ink, adapted to Vue

Modeled on React Ink (pinned to v7.0.4): every Ink component (6) and hook (13)
has a same-named equivalent, with `createApp().mount()` replacing Ink's
`render()`. Parity is verified against real Ink output captured as byte-exact
fixtures (Ink is not a runtime, test, or CI dependency). Where vue-tui differs —
`shallowRef` reactive state, declarative prop resets, `rawMode: 'always'`, and a
few fixes for verified Ink rendering bugs — it's deliberate and documented in the
divergence log. Parity never outranks correctness.

### Internal API (unstable)

The `@vue-tui/runtime/internal` entry point exposes lower-level host-node, Yoga,
and frame-sink internals for tooling (e.g. the test harness). It is **not covered
by semver** and may change in any release.
