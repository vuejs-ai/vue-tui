# Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- AGENTS.md is the source of truth. CLAUDE.md is a symlink to it.
- Always use Vue's `shallowRef` over `ref` by default. Using `ref` requires a solid justification and a code comment explaining why deep reactivity is needed.
- Always use `defineComponent()` to define components. Never use bare `{ setup() {} }` objects — they lack component scope, so `inject`, `watch`, and `onScopeDispose` won't work correctly.
- Vue SFCs must use `<script setup>` unless there's an explicit reason not to.
- Bug fixes must follow test-first: write a failing test that reproduces the bug, then fix the code and verify the test passes.
- After completing any task, run `vp run ready` (or `vpr ready`) to verify: lint, type-check, test all packages, and build.

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.
